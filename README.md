# What is Zilla?

![](./src/.vuepress/public/logo.svg)

**Zilla** is amazing open source software connecting web and mobile applications to event-driven microservices using standard protocols, such as HTTP, Server-Sent Events and Kafka.

Zilla is designed on the fundamental principle that _every data flow is a stream_, and that streams can be composed together to create efficient protocol transformation pipelines. This concept of a stream holds at both the network level for communication protocols and also at the application level for data processing.

Zilla's declarative configuration defines a routed graph of protocol decoders, transformers, encoders and caches that combine to provide a secure and stateless API entry point to your event-driven architecture.

For example, when deployed in front of a Kafka cluster, Zilla can be configured to support:

* HTTP request-response interaction with Kafka-based microservices
* HTTP event-driven caching populated by messages from a Kafka topic
* reliable message streaming from a Kafka topic via Server-Sent Events
* secure HTTP request-response APIs using JWT access tokens
* secure Server-Sent Events streams using continuous authorization via JWT access tokens

As a developer, you can focus on writing and testing your event-driven microservices with technologies such as Kafka consumers and producers, you can define your web and mobile APIs using Zilla, and then you can deploy securely at global scale.
