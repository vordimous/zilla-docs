# gRPC Proxy

This guide will walk through each unique gRPC message request and response design and how Zilla is configured to manage the connection for each.

Let's take a look at how Zilla would be configured with a full featured gRPC service. For this, we will use the [route_guide.proto](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/blob/master/examples/src/main/proto/route_guide.proto) to define the gRPC service and the method request-response types. You can find examples of running this service in any language on the [gRPC docs](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/) as well as example clients like this one implemented in [java](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/java/basics/#client).

## Step 1: Declaring the service

Zilla lets you use your service proto file(s) to specify the service definitions. This will let you create one or many [grpc-kafka](../../reference/config/binding/binding-grpc-kafka.md) proxy handlers to be used by the whole service or individual methods.

Here is the service we will be enhancing with Zilla and Kafka.

```protobuf
service RouteGuide {

  // simple RPC
  rpc GetFeature(Point) returns (Feature) {}

  // server-side streaming RPC
  rpc ListFeatures(Rectangle) returns (stream Feature) {}

  // client-side streaming RPC
  rpc RecordRoute(stream Point) returns (RouteSummary) {}

  // bidirectional streaming RPC
  rpc RouteChat(stream RouteNote) returns (stream RouteNote) {}
}
```

Here is the simplest configuration for declaring the gRPC service. There is a `server` defining the service and methods which exits to the `client` which can be routed to the running gRPC instance.

```yaml
grpc_server:
  type: grpc
  kind: server
  options:
    services:
      - route_guide.proto
  routes:
    - when:
        - method: routeguide.RouteGuide/*
      exit: grpc_client
grpc_client:
  type: grpc
  kind: client
```

Define individual route handlers for each method or specify the `*` wildcard to handle all methods the same.

- All messages handled by the same route

```yaml
routes:
  - when:
      - method: routeguide.RouteGuide/*
```

- Routes for individual service methods

```yaml
routes:
  - when:
      - method: routeguide.RouteGuide/GetFeature
```

## Step 2: Handling message routing onto Kafka

This maps the proto service method's request and response messages directly to Kafka topics defined by the `topic` and `reply-to` attributes respectively. The messages are linked by the `zilla:correlation-id` header for individual calls into the gRPC service. Read more about it and how the `idempotency-key` enables safe message replays in the [grpc-kafka](../../reference/config/binding/binding-grpc-kafka.md#produce-capability) reference section.

### Message routing for RPC request and response types

Let's look at some of the common service definitions and how Zilla can route their messages.

#### Simple RPC

For the `GetFeature` method, the `Point` request and `Feature` response create the stream of information Kafka can help manage.

```yaml
routes:
  - when:
      - method: routeguide.RouteGuide/GetFeature
    with:
      capability: produce
      topic: request-topic
      reply-to: response-topic
```

#### Server-side streaming RPC

For the `ListFeatures` method, we can have a dedicated stream of `Feature` messages being recorded on a topic before being sent to the client. Kafka allows the server to produce all of the responses without considering the connection to the client.

```yaml
routes:
  - when:
      - method: routeguide.RouteGuide/ListFeatures
    with:
      capability: produce
      topic: request-topic
      reply-to: feature-stream-topic
```

#### Client-side streaming RPC

For the `RecordRoute` method, the client sends a stream of `Point` messages to a dedicated stream topic before being sent to the server. Kafka allows the client to produce all of the requests without considering the connection to the server.

```yaml
routes:
  - when:
      - method: routeguide.RouteGuide/RecordRoute
    with:
      capability: produce
      topic: point-stream-topic
      reply-to: response-topic
```

#### Bidirectional streaming RPC

For the `RouteChat` method, we can have all of the messages on the same topic since it is the history that both the client and the server will need.

```yaml
routes:
  - when:
      - method: routeguide.RouteGuide/RouteChat
    with:
      capability: produce
      topic: chat-topic
```

### Fanout streaming RPC

An additional method for getting messages from a service onto Kafka is using the [grpc-kafka](../../reference/config/binding/binding-grpc-kafka.md) fetch capability. This enables message filtering and reliable message delivery. Read more about the [fetch capability](../../reference/config/binding/binding-grpc-kafka.md#fetch-capability) in the reference section.

The service will need a method that accepts the `google/protobuf/empty.proto` and produce the massage to be fanned out onto the Kafka topic.

```protobuf
import "google/protobuf/empty.proto";

service FanoutService
{
  rpc FanoutServerStream(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (stream FanoutMessage);
}
```

Here we set the [fetch capability](../../reference/config/binding/binding-grpc-kafka.md#fetch-capability) and a filter.

```yaml
grpc_kafka:
  type: grpc-kafka
  kind: proxy
  routes:
    - when:
        - method: example.FanoutService/*
      with:
        capability: fetch
        topic: messages
        filters:
          key: custom-key
          headers:
            custom-text: custom-value
```

## Step 3: Calling services from Kafka

Now that messages are in Kafka we need to send them to the gRPC services responsible for processing them. For this, we will be using the [kafka-grpc](../../reference/config/binding/binding-kafka-grpc.md) binding.

```yaml
remote_server:
  type: kafka-grpc
  kind: remote_server
  entry: <kafka_cache_client_name>
  options:
    acks: leader_only
  routes:
    - when:
        - topic: request-topic
          reply-to: response-topic
      exit: grpc_client
      with:
        scheme: http
        authority: localhost:9090
grpc_client:
  type: grpc
  kind: client
  options:
    services:
      - route_guide.proto
  routes:
    - when:
        - method: routeguide.RouteGuide/GetFeature
      exit: <http_client_name_for_grpc_host>
```

## Other important elements

Other aspects of routing traffic through Zilla, Kafka, and gRPC services can be summed up with reusable config setups.

### Connecting a gRPC service to Zilla

When a Zilla config refers to a `grpc` client the traffic will need to be routed through an `http` and `tcp` client down to the `<grpc_host>` `<grpc_port>`.

```yaml
grpc_client:
  type: grpc
  kind: client
  exit: http_client
http_client:
  type: http
  kind: client
  options:
    versions:
      - h2
  exit: tcp_client
tcp_client:
  type: tcp
  kind: client
  options:
    host: <grpc_host>
    port: <grpc_port>
```

### Gateway Ingress

Using a `tcp` and `tls` server we can route the gRPC traffic through an `http` server, `<ingress_host>`:`<ingress_port>`, to our desired gRPC server at the `<grpc_server_binding_name>`. This sets up the ingress section and by defining a [filesystem vault](../../reference/config/vault/vault-filesystem.md) a tls certificate can be used to send the traffic over https. Alternatively, if tls is not needed The tcp server can exit directly to the http server.

```yaml
  tcp_server:
    type: tcp
    kind: server
    options:
      host: 0.0.0.0
      port: <ingress_port>
    exit: tls_server
  tls_server:
    type: tls
    kind: server
    vault: server
    options:
      keys:
        - <ingress_host>
      sni:
        - <ingress_host>
      alpn:
        - h2
    exit: http_server
  http_server:
    type: http
    kind: server
    options:
      versions:
        - h2
      access-control:
        policy: cross-origin
    routes:
      - when:
          - headers:
              :scheme: https
              :authority: <ingress_host>:<ingress_port>
        exit: <grpc_server_binding_name>
```

### Connecting to Kafka

A gRPC server can connect to Kafka the same as any other binding in Zilla. [See the docs](../../how-tos/connecting-to-kafka/apache-kafka.md) on the different connection options.

```yaml
  kafka_cache_client:
    type: kafka
    kind: cache_client
    exit: kafka_cache_server
  kafka_cache_server:
    type: kafka
    kind: cache_server
    exit: kafka_client
  kafka_client:
    type: kafka
    kind: client
    exit: tcp_client
  tcp_client:
    type: tcp
    kind: client
    options:
      host: <kafka_host>
      port: <kafka_port>
    routes:
      - when:
          - cidr: 0.0.0.0/0
```
