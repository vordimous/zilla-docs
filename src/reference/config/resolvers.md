# Resolvers

Resolvers are a variable syntax for executing Zilla runtime functions that insert dynamic values into the zilla.yaml. Validation occurs before and after resolvers have been converted.

## Functions

### Environment Variables

The `env` resolver will read the specified environment variable from the host.

```text:no-line-numbers
${{ env.(Env_Var_Name) }}
```

### AWS Secrets Manager

The `aws.secrets` resolver can fetch an AWS Secrets Manager secret by its name (also called secretId) or its ARN.

```text:no-line-numbers
${{ aws.secrets.(Secret_Name) }}
${{ aws.secrets.(Secret_ARN) }}
```

If the secret is a key/value or JSON object this resolver can fetch individual properties by appending a `#` with the property name.

```text:no-line-numbers
${{ aws.secrets.(Secret_Name)#(JSON_Property_Name) }}
${{ aws.secrets.(Secret_ARN)#(JSON_Property_Name) }}
```
