# Zilla Runtime Configuration

The Zilla runtime configuration defines the [`bindings`](binding/), [`guards`](guard/), [`vaults`](vault/), and [`telemetry`](telemetry/) used by the Zilla runtime engine. The values of properties in the configuration can be literals or expressions of the form `${{env.VARIABLE}}` to resolve a local environment variable value instead.

```yaml {2}
---
name: zilla config
telemetry:
  ...

vaults:
  ...

guards:
  ...

bindings:
  ...
```

## Summary

This binding supports the `echo` protocol and is run with the `server` behavior. It reads inbound messages and writes it back to the sender.

### name\*

> `string`

Namespace name.

### bindings

> `object` as map of named [`binding`](binding) properties

Each configured `binding` represents a step in the pipeline as data streams are decoded, translated or encoded according to a specific protocol `type`.

A `binding` also has a `kind`, indicating how it should behave, such as `server`, `proxy` or `client`.

As each incoming data stream arrives, the binding follows its configured `routes` to reach an `exit` binding, or rejects the stream if no routes are viable. Route matching conditions are defined in terms specific to each `binding` type.

See each of the specific `binding` types linked below for more detailed examples.

Behavioral type supporting either encoding and decoding for a specific protocol or translation between protocols.

#### routes.exit <!--  TODO move to individual reference docs -->

> `string`

Unconditional `exit` binding acting as a default if none of the conditional routes are viable.

### guards

> `object` as map of named [`guard`](guard) properties

Each configured `guard` represents a security checkpoint for one or more bindings based on a specific implementation `type`.

Guards can be used by specific protocol bindings to enforce authorization requirements.

Associated roles can be enforced during routing by only following routes `guarded` by specific role requirements when authorized. This implicitly supports falling through to lower privilege routes when `guarded` higher privilege routes are not authorized.

See each of the specific `guard` types linked below for more detailed examples.

### vaults

> `object` as map of named [`vault`](vault) properties

Each configured `vault` represents a container for digital keys and certificates based on a specific implementation `type`.

Vaults can be used by specific protocol bindings, such as `tls`, to negotiate shared encryption keys.

See each of the specific `vault` types linked below for more detailed examples.


### telemetry

> `object` of [`telemetry`](telemetry) properties

```yaml
telemetry:
  attributes:
    service.namespace: example
  exporters:
    ...
  metrics:
    ...
```

#### attributes

> `object`

Default attributes to optionally include when exporting metrics.

#### exporters

> `object` as map of named [`exporter`](telemetry/exporter/) properties

Map of named exporters.

#### metrics

> `array` of `string` of named [`metrics`](telemetry/metrics/)

Array of named metrics.
