# tls Binding

Zilla runtime tls binding.

```yaml {2}
tls_server:
  type: tls
  kind: server
  vault: server
  options:
    keys:
      - localhost
    sni:
      - localhost
    alpn:
      - echo
  routes:
    - when:
        - alpn: echo
    exit: echo_server
```

## Summary

Defines a binding with `tls` protocol support, with `server`, `client` or `proxy` behavior.

#### Server behavior

The `server` kind tls binding decodes encrypted `TLS` protocol on the inbound network stream, producing higher level cleartext application streams for each request.

Certificates and keys required to complete the `TLS` handshake are provided by a `vault` referenced in the binding configuration.

Conditional routes based on `tls` hostname authority or negotiated ALPN protocol are used to route these streams to an `exit` binding.

#### Client behavior

The `client` kind `tls` binding receives inbound application streams and encodes each as an encrypted network stream via `TLS` protocol.

Certificates and keys required to complete the `TLS` handshake are provided by a `vault` referenced in the binding configuration.

Conditional routes based on `tls` hostname authority or negotiated ALPN protocol are used to route these streams to an `exit` binding.

#### Proxy behavior

The `proxy` kind `tls` binding detects `ClientHello` `server_name` extension to provide TLS virtual hosting by routing based on server name.

A `vault` is not required to proxy `TLS` protocol as the handshake is only observed read-only as it routes through the `tls` `proxy` binding.
