# tcp Binding

Zilla runtime tcp binding.

```yaml {2}
tcp_server0:
  type: tcp
  kind: server
  options:
    host: 0.0.0.0
    port: 12345
  exit: echo_server0
```

## Summary

Defines a binding with `tcp` protocol support, with `server` or `client` behavior.

The `server` kind `tcp` binding listens for inbound socket connections, producing higher level application streams for each remote `tcp` client.

The `client` kind `tcp` binding receives inbound application streams and initiates outbound `tcp` network connections to a remote `tcp` server address.

Conditional routes based on the hostname authority and network address mask are used to route these streams to an `exit` binding.

## Configuration

### kind\*

> `enum` [ "client", "server" ]

Behave as a `tcp` `client` or `server`.

```yaml
exit: echo_server0
```

### routes

> `array` of `object`

Conditional `tcp`-specific routes.
