# mqtt Binding ðŸ”œ

Zilla runtime mqtt binding (incubator).

```yaml {2}
mqtt_server:
  type: mqtt
  kind: server
  routes:
    - when:
        - topic: messages
          capabilities: publish_and_subscribe
      exit: mqtt_kafka_proxy0
```

## Summary

Defines a binding with `mqtt 5.0` protocol support, with `server` behavior.

The `server` kind `mqtt` binding decodes `mqtt 5.0` protocol on the inbound network stream, producing higher level application streams for each `publish` or `subscribe` `topic`. The `session` state is also described by a higher level application stream.

Conditional routes based on the `topic` `name` are used to route these application streams to an `exit` binding.

## Configuration
