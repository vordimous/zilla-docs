# http Binding

Zilla runtime http binding.

```yaml {2}
http_server0:
  type: http
  kind: server
  options:
    access-control:
      policy: cross-origin
    authorization:
      jwt0:
        credentials:
          headers:
            authorization: Bearer {credentials}
  routes:
    - when:
        - headers:
            ":scheme": https
            ":authority": example.com:443
      exit: echo_server0
```

## Summary

Defines a binding with `http` protocol support, with `server` or `client` behavior.

#### Server behavior

The `server` kind `http` binding decodes `HTTP/1.1` protocol or `HTTP/2` protocol on the inbound network stream, producing higher level application streams for each request.

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is supported by specifying an access control policy of `cross-origin`. Further configuration allows for finer-grained access control including specific request origins, methods and headers allowed, and specific response headers exposed.

Authorization is enforced by a [`guard`](../guard/README.md) and the credentials can be extracted from a cookie, header or query parameter.

Conditional routes based on `http` request headers are used to route these application streams to an `exit` binding.

#### Client behavior

The `client` kind `http` binding receives inbound application streams and encodes each request as a network stream via `HTTP/1.1` protocol. Note that the same network stream can be reused to encode multiple `HTTP/1.1` requests.

Conditional routes based on `http` request headers are used to route these network streams to an `exit` binding.

> `object`

`http`-specific options.

```yaml
options:
  access-control:
    policy: cross-origin
  authorization:
    jwt0:
      credentials:
        headers:
          authorization: Bearer {credentials}
```

### options.versions

> `array` of `enum` [ "http/1.1", "h2" ]

Supported protocol versions.

### options.access-control

> **oneOf**: [same-origin](#access-control-policy-same-origin) | [cross-origin](#access-control-policy-cross-origin)

Access control policy for the `HTTP` protocol.

#### access-control.policy\*

> `enum` [ "same-origin" , "cross-origin" ]

Supported access control policies.

#### access-control.policy (same-origin)

> `string`

Extra properties aren't needed when using Same Origin access control for the `HTTP` protocol.

```yaml
options:
  access-control:
    policy: same-origin
```

#### access-control.policy (cross-origin)

> `object`

Additional properties that cover Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) access control for the `HTTP` protocol.

```yaml
options:
  access-control:
    policy: cross-origin
```

#### access-control.allow

> `object`

Allowed cross-origin request origins, methods, headers and credentials.\
Defaults to all origins, methods and headers, without credentials.
CORS allowed request origins, methods, headers and credentials for the `HTTP` protocol.

##### allow.origins

Allowed request origins.

##### allow.methods

> `array` of `string`

Allowed request methods.

##### allow.headers

Exposed cross-origin response headers.\
Defaults to all response headers.

##### expose.headers

> `array` of `string`

Exposed response headers.

### options.authorization

> `object` as map of named properties

Authorization by guard for the `HTTP/1.1` and `HTTP/2` protocols.

Named cookie value pattern with `{credentials}`.

##### credentials.headers

> `object` as map of `string`

Named header value pattern with `{credentials}`, e.g. `"Bearer` `{credentials}"`.

##### credentials.query

> `object` as map of `string`

Named query parameter value pattern with `{credentials}`.

### options.overrides

> `object` of name-value header overrides

Request header overrides.

### exit

> `string`

Default exit binding when no conditional routes are viable.

```yaml
exit: echo_server0
```

### routes

> `array` of `object`

Conditional `http`-specific routes.

```yaml
routes:
  - when:
      - headers:
