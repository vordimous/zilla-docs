# fan Binding

Zilla runtime fan binding.

```yaml {2}
fan_server:
  type: fan
  kind: server
  exit: echo_server
```

## Summary

Defines a binding with `fan-in` and `fan-out` support, with `server` behavior.

The `server` kind `fan` binding performs fan-in of data on all inbound network streams, grouping them into a single application stream. Then data received from the application stream is fanned-out to all network streams in the group.

When the `exit` is an `echo` server binding, the combination reflects all inbound data from each client to all clients.
