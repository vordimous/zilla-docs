# Create Client Certificate (ACM)

You can use the following script to create a client certificate signed by an AWS Private Certificate Authority and upload the client private key to AWS SecretsManager.

::: details create_client_certificate.sh

```bash
#!/bin/bash

while [ $# -gt 0 ]; do
    if [[ $1 == "--"* ]]; then
        v="${1/--/}"
        v="${v//-/$'_'}"
        declare "$v"="$2"
        shift
    fi
    shift
done

programname=$0

function usage {
    echo ""
    echo "Creates signed client certificate and uploads client private key to SecretsManager"
    echo ""
    echo "usage: $programname --client-name string  --acm-pca-certificate-authority string"
    echo ""
    echo "  --client-name string                         name of the client"
    echo "                                               (example: client-1)"
    echo "  --acm-pca-certificate-authority string       AWS private certificate authority arn"
    echo "                                               (example: arn:aws:acm-pca:us-east-1..:certificate-authority)"
    echo ""
}

function die {
    printf "Script failed: %s\n\n" "$1"
    exit 1
}

if [[ -z $client_name ]]; then
    usage
    die "Missing parameter --client-name"
elif [[ -z $acm_pca_certificate_authority ]]; then
    usage

aws acm-pca get-certificate \
  --region us-east-1 \
  --certificate-arn "$clientCertArn" \
  --certificate-authority-arn "$acm_pca_certificate_authority" \
  --output text | sed "s/\t/\n/g" > "$client_name".cert

```

## Resource Parameters

The following parameters are needed when following these steps to create a new client certificate using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).

* Common Name
* Private Certificate Authority

Throughout this guide we use the following example client certificate parameters.

* Client Identity
  * Common Name `client-1`
* Private Certificate Authority
  * Name `Mutual Authentication CA`

## Create the Certificate Authority

If you do not already have one, follow the [Create Certificate Authority (ACM)](create-certificate-authority-acm.md) guide to create a new private certificate authority in AWS Certificate Manager.

::: info
Note the ARN of the private certificate authority.
:::

## Generate the RSA key

We need to create a new key that will be used with the certificate, and store the key in `pkcs8` format. In this example we will be creating the key for a client certificate with `client-1` as the common name.

```shell:no-line-numbers
openssl genrsa -out client-1.key.pem 4096
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -in client-1.key.pem -out client-1.pkcs8.pem
```

## Create the signing request

Next we need to create a certificate corresponding to the key, with metadata about the owner of the certificate and the common name. This is done by first creating a certificate signing request.

```shell:no-line-numbers
openssl req -new -key client-1.key.pem -out client-1.csr

You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) []:US
State or Province Name (full name) []:California
Locality Name (eg, city) []:Palo Alto
Organization Name (eg, company) []:Aklivity
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:Development
Common Name (eg, fully qualified host name) []:client-1
Email Address []:

Please enter the following 'extra' attributes
to be sent with your certificate request
A challenge password []:
An optional company name []:
```

::: tip
This creates the signing request in `client-1.csr`.
:::

## Issue the signed certificate

Now that the certificate signing request has been prepared, it can be used to issue a new certificate signed by your private certificate authority.

In this example, we issue the certificate to be valid for `365 days`. You should choose a validity period that best suits your specific use case.

```shell:no-line-numbers
aws acm-pca issue-certificate \
  --region us-east-1 \
  --certificate-authority-arn <private-certificate-authority-arn> \
  --csr fileb://client-1.csr \
  --signing-algorithm "SHA256WITHRSA" \
  --validity Value=365,Type="DAYS" \
  --idempotency-token 1234
```

This command returns the ARN of the newly signed certificate.

```shell:no-line-numbers
{
    "CertificateArn": "arn:aws:acm-pca:us-east-1:...:certificate-authority/.../certificate/..."
}
```

Now the signed certificate can be retrieved from AWS Private Certificate Authority using the .

```shell:no-line-numbers
aws acm-pca get-certificate \
  --region us-east-1 \
  --certificate-arn <client-certificate-arn>
  --certificate-authority-arn <private-certificate-authority-arn>
  --output text | sed "s/\t/\n/g" > client_1.cert
```

This returns the public signed client certificate chain associated with the client private key.

## Store the encrypted secret

Now we need to create the secret value using the `pkcs8` encoded private key as the secret value and with secret tags `certificate-authority-arn` referencing the private certificate authority, and `certificate-arn` referencing the newly signed certificate.

```shell:no-line-numbers
aws secretsmanager create-secret \
  --region us-east-1 \
  --name "client-1" \
  --secret-string file://client-1.pkcs8.pem \
  --tags '[{"Key":"certificate-authority-arn", "Value":"arn:aws:acm-pca:us-east-1:...:certificate-authority/..."}, {"Key":"certificate-arn", "Value":"arn:aws:acm-pca:us-east-1:...:certificate-authority/.../certificate/..."}]'
```

This secret can now be used by the Aklivity Public MSK Proxy to resolve private keys and their corresponding signed certificates to support TLS client authentication.

::: info
Note the ARN of the newly created secret for the client certificate's private key.
:::

::: warning
In the example above, private certificates are valid for `365 days`, so you will need to renew the certificate and update the secret value accordingly before expiration. The latest secret value and corresponding private certificate are obtained automatically upon restarting the MSK Proxy instance.
