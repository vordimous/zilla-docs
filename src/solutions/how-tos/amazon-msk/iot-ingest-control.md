## Overview

The [Zilla Plus for Amazon MSK](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-jshnzslazfm44) IoT Ingest and Control MQTT Broker lets clients publish messages and subscribe to topics that are proxied to Kafka topics in your Amazon MSK cluster.

## Prerequisites

<!-- @include: @partials/iot-ingest-control/prerequisites.md  -->

## Create the Amazon MSK cluster

> This creates your MSK cluster in preparation for secure access via the internet.

An MSK cluster is needed for secure remote access via the internet. You can skip this step if you have already created an MSK cluster with equivalent configuration.

Follow the [Create MSK Cluster](../aws-services/create-msk-cluster.md) guide to setup the a new MSK cluster. We will use the below resource names to reference the AWS resources needed in this guide.

- Cluster Name: `my-zilla-iot-msk-cluster`
- Access control methods: `SASL/SCRAM authentication`

With a running MSK Cluster you will need to create these topics. You can reference this AWS developer guide for help [creating topics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/msk/latest/developerguide/create-topic.html).

- Topics:

  - With cleanup policy "delete" to store MQTT messages:

  ```text:no-line-numbers
  mqtt-messages
  ```

  - With cleanup policy "compact" to store MQTT retained messages:

  ```text:no-line-numbers
  mqtt-retained
  ```

  - With cleanup policy "compact" to store MQTT sessions:

  ```text:no-line-numbers
  mqtt-sessions
  ```

### Create a Secret with SASL/SCRAM authentication params

<!-- @include: @partials/zilla-plus-proxy/msk-access-secret.md  -->

Go to the newly created secret and under `Resource permissions` > select `Edit Permissions`. Add the below `AWSKafkaResourcePolicy` and replace the resource secret name with your SASL/SCRAM auth secret name.

```json:no-line-numbers
{
  "Version" : "2012-10-17",
  "Statement" : [ {
    "Sid" : "AWSKafkaResourcePolicy",
    "Effect" : "Allow",
    "Principal" : {
      "Service" : "kafka.amazonaws.com"
    },
    "Action" : "secretsmanager:getSecretValue",
    "Resource" : "arn:aws:secretsmanager:*:*:secret:<SASL/SCRAM auth secret name>*"
  } ]
}
```

## Subscribe via AWS Marketplace

The [Zilla Plus for Amazon MSK](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-jshnzslazfm44)) is available through the AWS Marketplace. You can skip this step if you have already subscribed to Zilla Plus for Amazon MSK via the AWS Marketplace.

To get started, visit the Proxy's Marketplace [Product Page](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-jshnzslazfm44) and `Subscribe` to the offering. You should now see `Zilla Plus for Amazon MSK` listed in your [AWS Marketplace](https://console.aws.amazon.com/marketplace) subscriptions.

## Deploy the IoT Ingest and Control MQTT Broker

> This initiates deployment of the Zilla Plus for Amazon MSK stack via CloudFormation.

Navigate to your [AWS Marketplace](https://console.aws.amazon.com/marketplace) subscriptions and select `Zilla Plus for Amazon MSK` to show the manage subscription page.

  - Key pair for SSH access: `my-key-pair` \*5
- \*Configuration Reference
  1. This is the ARN for the secret created in the [Create a Secret with SASL/SCRAM authentication params](#create-a-secret-with-sasl-scram-authentication-params) step of this guide.
  2. Consider the network throughput characteristics of the AWS instance type as that will impact the upper bound on network performance.
  3. Replace with your own custom wildcard DNS pattern mentioned in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) of this guide.
  4. This is the ARN of the created secret for the signed certificate's private key mentioned in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) of this guide.
  5. Follow the [Create Key Pair](../../how-tos/aws-services/create-key-pair.md) guide to create a new key pair to access EC2 instances via SSH.
