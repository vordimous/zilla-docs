## Prerequisites

Before setting up internet access to your MSK Cluster, you will need the following:

- an MSK Cluster configured for TLS encrypted client access
- subscription to Zilla Plus for Amazon MSK via AWS Marketplace
- an VPC security group for the <ZillaPlus/> proxies
- an IAM security role for the <ZillaPlus/> proxies
- permission to modify local DNS resolution files, such as `/etc/hosts` on MacOS

::: tip
Check out the [Troubleshooting](../../aws-services/troubleshooting.md) guide if you run into any issues.
:::

### Create the MSK Cluster

> This creates your MSK cluster in preparation for secure access via the internet.

An MSK cluster is needed for secure remote access via the internet. You can skip this step if you have already created an MSK cluster with equivalent configuration.

Follow the [Create MSK Cluster](../../aws-services/create-msk-cluster.md) guide to setup the a new MSK cluster. We will use the below resource names to reference the AWS resources needed in this guide.

- Cluster Name: `my-msk-cluster`
- Access control methods: `Unauthenticated access`
- VPC: `my-msk-cluster-vpc`
- Subnet: `my-msk-cluster-subnet-*`
- Route tables: `my-msk-cluster-rtb-*`
- Internet gateway: `my-msk-cluster-igw`

### Create the <ZillaPlus/> proxy security group

> This creates your <ZillaPlus/> proxy security group to allow Kafka clients and SSH access.

A VPC security group is needed for the <ZillaPlus/> proxies when they are launched.

Follow the [Create Security Group](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpcconsole/home#CreateSecurityGroup:) wizard with the following parameters and defaults. This creates your <ZillaPlus/> proxy security group to allow Kafka clients and SSH access.

- VPC: `my-msk-cluster-vpc`
- Name: `my-zilla-proxy-sg`
- Description: `Kafka clients and SSH access`
- Add Inbound Rule
  - Type: `CUSTOM TCP`
  - Port Range: `9094`
  - Source type: `Anywhere-IPv4`
- Add Inbound Rule
  - Type: `SSH`
  - Source type: `My IP`
- Add Outbound Rule (if not exists)
  - Type: `All traffic`
  - Destination: `Anywhere-IPv4`
- Create the Security Group

::: warning Check your network settings
Your IP may be different when you SSH into the EC2 instance. VPNs and other networking infrastructure may cause the `My IP` inbound rule to fail. Instead, you can use one of the other ways AWS provides to execute commands in an EC2 instance.
:::

### Update the default security group rules

> This allows the <ZillaPlus/> proxies to communicate with your MSK cluster.

Navigate to the VPC Management Console [Security Groups](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home#securityGroups:) table.

::: note Check your selected region
Make sure you have selected the desired region, ex: `US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1`.
:::

Filter the security groups by selecting a `VPC` and select the `default` security group.

- VPC: `my-msk-cluster-vpc`
- Security Group: `default`

#### Add a Custom TCP Rule

Add this Inbound Rule to allow the <ZillaPlus/> proxies to communicate with the MSK cluster.

- Type: `Custom TCP`
- Port Range: `9094`
- Source type: `Custom`
- Source: `my-zilla-proxy-sg`

### Create the <ZillaPlus/> proxy IAM security role

> This creates an IAM security role to enable the required AWS services for the <ZillaPlus/> proxies.

Follow the [Create IAM Role](../../aws-services/create-iam-role.md) guide to create an IAM security role with the following parameters:

::: code-tabs

@tab Name

```text:no-line-numbers
aklivity-zilla-proxy
```

@tab Policies

```text:no-line-numbers
AWSCertificateManagerReadOnly
AWSCertificateManagerPrivateCAReadOnly
ResourceGroupsandTagEditorReadOnlyAccess
AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore
```

:::

#### IAM role Inline Policies

This creates an IAM security role to enable the required AWS services for the <ZillaPlus/> proxies.

::: code-tabs

@tab Name

```text:no-line-numbers
MSKProxySecretsManagerRead
```

@tab JSON Summary

```json:no-line-numbers
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
        "secretsmanager:DescribeSecret"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:secretsmanager:*:*:secret:wildcard.aklivity.example.com-*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

:::

::: info If you used a different secret name for your certificate key.

Replace `wildcard.example.aklivity.io` in the resource regular expression for:

```text:no-line-numbers
MSKProxySecretsManagerRead
```

:::

## Subscribe via AWS Marketplace

The [Zilla Plus for Amazon MSK](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-jshnzslazfm44) is available through the AWS Marketplace. You can skip this step if you have already subscribed to Zilla Plus for Amazon MSK via AWS Marketplace.

To get started, visit the Proxy's Marketplace [Product Page](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-jshnzslazfm44) and `Subscribe` to the offering. You should now see `Zilla Plus for Amazon MSK` listed in your [AWS Marketplace](https://console.aws.amazon.com/marketplace) subscriptions.

## Create the Server Certificate

We need a TLS Server Certificate for the wildcard domain `*.aklivity.example.com` that can be trusted by a Kafka Client.

Follow the [Create Server Certificate](../../aws-services/create-server-certificate-acm.md) guide to create a new TLS Server Certificate for the example wildcard domain `*.aklivity.example.com`.

::: info
Note the server certificate secret ARN as we will need to reference it from the Secure Public Access CloudFormation template.
:::

::: warning
Store the private CA certificate in a file called `pca.pem` as we will need it to configure trust when testing the Kafka client.
:::

## Deploy the Zilla Plus Secure Public Access Proxy

> This initiates deployment of the Zilla Plus for Amazon MSK stack via CloudFormation.

Navigate to your [AWS Marketplace](https://console.aws.amazon.com/marketplace) subscriptions and select `Zilla Plus for Amazon MSK` to show the manage subscription page.

- From the `Agreement` section > `Actions` menu > select `Launch CloudFormation stack`
- Select the `Secure Public Access (Unauthorized/SASL)` fulfillment option
- Make sure you have selected the desired region selected, such as `us-east-1`
- Click `Continue to Launch`
  - Choose the action `Launch CloudFormation`

Click `Launch` to complete the `Create stack` wizard with the following details:

### Step 1. Create Stack

- Prepare template: `Template is ready`
- Specify template: `Amazon S3 URL`
  - Amazon S3 URL: `(auto-filled)`

### Step 2. Specify stack details

::: code-tabs

@tab Stack name

```text:no-line-numbers
my-zilla-proxy
```

:::

Parameters:

- Network Configuration
  - VPC: `my-msk-cluster-vpc`
  - Subnets: `my-msk-cluster-1a` `my-msk-cluster-1b` `my-msk-cluster-1c`
- MSK Configuration
  - Wildcard DNS pattern: `*.aklivity.[...].amazonaws.com` *1
  - Port number: `9094`
- Secure Public Access Configuration
  - Instance count: `2`
  - Instance type: `t3.small` *2
  - Role: `aklivity-zilla-proxy`
  - Security Groups: `my-zilla-proxy`
  - Secrets Manager Secret ARN: `<TLS certificate private key secret ARN>` *3
  - Public Wildcard DNS: `*.aklivity.example.com`
  - Public Port: `9094`
  - Key pair for SSH access: `my-key-pair` *4
- *Configuration Reference
  1. Follow the [Lookup MSK Server Names](../../aws-services/lookup-msk-server-names.md) guide to discover the wildcard DNS pattern for your MSK cluster.
  2. Consider the network throughput characteristics of the AWS instance type as that will impact the upper bound on network performance.
  3. This is the ARN of the created secret for the signed certificate's private key that was returned in the last step of the [Create Server Certificate](../../aws-services/create-server-certificate-acm.md#store-the-encrypted-secret) guide.
  4. Follow the [Create Key Pair](../../aws-services/create-key-pair.md) guide to create a new key pair to access EC2 instances via SSH.

### Step 3. Configure stack options: `(use defaults)`

### Step 4. Review

Confirm the stack details are correct and `Submit` to start the CloudFormation deploy.

::: info
When your <ZillaPlus/> proxy is ready, the [CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation) will show `CREATE_COMPLETE` for the newly created stack.
:::

## Verify <ZillaPlus/> proxy Service

> This checks that the services and networking were properly configured.

Navigate to the [EC2 running instances dashboard.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home#Instances:instanceState=running)

::: note Check your selected region
Make sure you have selected the desired region, ex: `US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1`.
:::

Select either of the <ZillaPlus/> proxies launched by the CloudFormation template to show the details.

::: info
They each have an IAM Role name starting with `aklivity-zilla-proxy`.
:::

Find the `Public IPv4 Address` and then SSH into the instance.

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/<key-pair.cer> ec2-user@<instance-public-ip-address>
```

After logging in via SSH, check the status of the `zilla-plus` system service.

::: tabs

@tab Service is running

Verify that the `zilla-plus` service is active and logging output similar to that shown below.

```bash
systemctl status zilla-plus.service
```

```output:no-line-numbers
zilla-plus.service - Zilla Plus
   Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/zilla-plus.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)
   Active: active (running) since...
```

@tab Check Ports

Check for the active ports with `netstat`.

```bash
netstat -ntlp
```

```output:no-line-numbers
tcp6    0    0 :::9092    :::*    LISTEN    1726/.zpm/image/bin
```

@tab Check Zilla Logs

You can get an stdout dump of the `zilla-plus.service` using `journalctl`.

```bash
journalctl -e -u zilla-plus.service | tee -a /tmp/zilla.log
```

```output:no-line-numbers
systemd[1]: Started zilla-plus.service - Zilla Plus.
...
```

@tab Check Cloud Init Logs

All output from cloud-init is captured by default to `/var/log/cloud-init-output.log`. There shouldn't be any errors in this log.

```bash
cat /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
```

```output:no-line-numbers
Cloud-init v. 22.2.2 running 'init'...
```

:::

Check the networking of the <ZillaPlus/> proxy instances to MSK.

::: tabs

@tab DNS resolving

Verify that the instance can resolve the private Route53 DNS address.

```bash
nslookup *.aklivity.[...].amazonaws.com
```

```output:no-line-numbers
Server:		***
Address:	***

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	*.aklivity.[...].amazonaws.com
Address: ***
```

@tab Check Ports

Check the communication over necessary ports with `netcat`.

```bash
nc -vz *.aklivity.[...].amazonaws.com 9096
```

```output:no-line-numbers
Connection to *.aklivity.[...].amazonaws.com port 9096 [tcp/italk] succeeded!
```

:::

Repeat these steps for each of the other <ZillaPlus/> proxies launched by the CloudFormation template if necessary.

## Verify Kafka Client Connectivity

<!-- @include: @partials/secure-public-access/verify-kafka-connect.md  -->

### Trust the Private Certificate Authority

Import the private CA certificate into your trust store.

```bash
keytool -importcert -keystore /tmp/kafka.client.truststore.jks -storetype jks -storepass generated -alias pca -file Certificate.pem
```

::: info
When you followed the [Create Certificate Authority](../../aws-services/create-certificate-authority-acm.md) guide, you exported the private CA certificate to a file called `Certificate.pem`.
:::

### Configure the Kafka Client

With the Kaka client now installed we are ready to configure it and point it at the <ZillaPlus/> proxy.

The <ZillaPlus/> proxy relies on TLS so we need to create a file called `client.properties` that tells the Kafka client to use SSL as the security protocol and to trust your private certificate authority as the signer of the `*.aklivity.example.com` certificate.

::: code-tabs

@tab client.properties

```text:no-line-numbers
security.protocol=SSL
ssl.truststore.location=/tmp/kafka.client.truststore.jks
```

:::

### Configure Local DNS

When using an example wildcard DNS such as `*.aklivity.example.com` then the DNS entries are setup locally.

Navigate to the [CloudFormation console.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation) Then select the `my-zilla-proxy` stack to show the details.

::: note Check your selected region
Make sure you have selected the desired region, ex: `US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1`.
:::

In the stack `Outputs` tab, find the public DNS name of the `NetworkLoadBalancer`, and lookup the public IP addresses, as shown in the following example.

```bash
nslookup my-pu-Netwo-xxxxxxxxxxxx-yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.elb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

```output:no-line-numbers
Server:  10.5.1.21
Address: 10.5.1.21#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name: my-pu-Netwo-xxxxxxxxxxxx-yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.elb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
Address: 107.21.117.233
Name: my-pu-Netwo-xxxxxxxxxxxx-yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.elb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
Address: 54.235.158.55
Name: my-pu-Netwo-xxxxxxxxxxxx-yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.elb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
Address: 3.226.64.246
```

Then add local DNS entries for the bootstrap proxy names needed by the Kafka client to `/etc/hosts`.

::: code-tabs

@tab /etc/hosts

```text:no-line-numbers
107.21.117.233  b-1.aklivity.example.com b-2.aklivity.example.com b-3.aklivity.example.com
54.235.158.55   b-1.aklivity.example.com b-2.aklivity.example.com b-3.aklivity.example.com
3.226.64.246    b-1.aklivity.example.com b-2.aklivity.example.com b-3.aklivity.example.com
```

:::

This allows Kafka clients to use the following TLS bootstrap proxy names for privately signed TLS wildcard certificate:

```text:no-line-numbers
b-1.aklivity.example.com:9094,b-2.aklivity.example.com:9094,b-3.aklivity.example.com:9094
```

You can use these bootstrap server names when connecting to your MSK cluster.

::: warning
If you add another broker to your MSK cluster, then you will need to add another local DNS entry, such as `b-4.aklivity.example.com`. This is required only for [MSK Unauthorized access](./development.md) deployments, not [MSK SASL/SCRAM authentication](./production.md) or [MSK mTLS authentication](./production-mutual-tls.md)deployments.
:::

### Test the Kafka Client

> This verifies internet connectivity to your MSK cluster via Zilla Plus for Amazon MSK.

We can now verify that the Kafka client can successfully communicate with your MSK cluster via the internet to create a topic, then publish and subscribe to the same topic.

Use the following as TLS bootstrap server names for the Kafka client:

```text:no-line-numbers
b-1.aklivity.example.com:9094,b-2.aklivity.example.com:9094,b-3.aklivity.example.com:9094
```

#### Create a Topic

<!-- @include: @partials/secure-public-access/create-topic.md  -->

::: tip A quick summary of what just happened

1. The Kafka client with access to the public internet issued a request to create a new topic
1. This request was directed to the internet-facing Network Load Balancer
1. The Network Load Balancer forwarded the request to the <ZillaPlus/> proxy
1. The <ZillaPlus/> proxy routed the request to the appropriate MSK broker
1. The topic was created in the MSK broker
1. Public access was verified
