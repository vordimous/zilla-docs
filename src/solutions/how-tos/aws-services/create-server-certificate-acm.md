# Create Server Certificate

## Create the Certificate Authority

Follow the [Create Certificate Authority](./create-certificate-authority-acm.md) guide with these parameters to create a new private certificate authority in AWS Certificate Manager.

### Distinguished Name

Common Name (CN): `Test CA`

::: info
Note the ARN of the private certificate authority.
:::

## Generate the RSA key

We need to create a new key that will be used with the certificate, and store the key in `pkcs8` format. In this example we will be creating the key for a wildcard certificate with `*.aklivity.example.com` as the common name.

```bash
openssl genrsa -out wildcard.aklivity.example.com.key.pem 4096
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -in wildcard.aklivity.example.com.key.pem -out wildcard.aklivity.example.com.pkcs8.pem
```

## Create the signing request

Next we need to create a certificate corresponding to the key, with metadata about the owner of the certificate and the common name. This is done by first creating a certificate signing request.

```bash
openssl req -new -key wildcard.aklivity.example.com.key.pem -out wildcard.aklivity.example.com.csr
```

```output:no-line-numbers
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) []:US
State or Province Name (full name) []:California
Locality Name (eg, city) []:Palo Alto
Organization Name (eg, company) []:Aklivity
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:Development
Common Name (eg, fully qualified host name) []:*.aklivity.example.com
Email Address []:

Please enter the following 'extra' attributes
to be sent with your certificate request
A challenge password []:
An optional company name []:
```

::: info
This creates the signing request in `wildcard.aklivity.example.com.csr`.
:::

## Issue the signed certificate

Now that the certificate signing request has been prepared, it can be used to issue a new certificate signed by your private certificate authority.

In this example, we issue the certificate to be valid for `365 days`. You should choose a validity period that best suits your specific use case.

```bash
aws acm-pca issue-certificate \
--region us-east-1 \
--certificate-authority-arn <private-certificate-authority-arn> \
--csr fileb://wildcard.aklivity.example.com.csr \
--signing-algorithm "SHA256WITHRSA" \
--validity Value=365,Type="DAYS" \
--idempotency-token 1234
```

This command returns the ARN of the newly signed certificate.

```json:no-line-numbers
{
  "CertificateArn": "arn:aws:acm-pca:us-east-1:...:certificate-authority/.../certificate/..."
}
```

::: info
Note the certificate ARN as we need to reference it later.
:::

::: warning
If you see the following error when attempting to run the command

`An error occurred (UnrecognizedClientException) when calling the IssueCertificate operation: The security token included in the request is invalid`

make sure that you have retrieved and set [your AWS credentials](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/aws-single-sign-on-now-enables-command-line-interface-access-for-aws-accounts-using-corporate-credentials/) for CLI use.
:::

## Store the encrypted secret

Now we need to create the secret value using the `pkcs8` encoded private key as the secret value and with secret tags `certificate-authority-arn` referencing the private certificate authority, and `certificate-arn` referencing the newly signed certificate.

```bash
aws secretsmanager create-secret \
--region us-east-1 \
--name "wildcard.aklivity.example.com" \
--secret-string file://wildcard.aklivity.example.com.pkcs8.pem \
--tags '[{"Key":"certificate-authority-arn", "Value":"arn:aws:acm-pca:us-east-1:...:certificate-authority/..."}, {"Key":"certificate-arn", "Value":"arn:aws:acm-pca:us-east-1:...:certificate-authority/.../certificate/..."}]'
```

This secret can now be used by the Zilla Plus for Amazon MSK to resolve private keys and their corresponding signed certificates to support custom TLS bootstrap server names.

::: info
Note the ARN of the newly created secret for the signed certificate's private key.
:::

::: warning
In the example above, private certificates are valid for `365 days`, so you will need to renew the certificate and update the `secret-string` value and `certificate-arn` tag accordingly before expiration. The latest secret value and corresponding private certificate are obtained automatically upon restarting the Zilla proxy instance.
