# Confluent Cloud IoT Ingest and Control

[Available in <ZillaPlus/>](https://www.aklivity.io/products/zilla-plus)
{.zilla-plus-badge .hint-container .info}

::: info Estimated time to complete 10-15 minutes.
:::

## Overview

The [Zilla Plus for Confluent Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-eblxkinsqbaks) IoT Ingest and Control MQTT Broker lets clients publish messages and subscribe to topics that are proxied to Kafka topics in your Confluent Cloud Kafka cluster.

## Prerequisites

<!-- @include: @partials/iot-ingest-control/prerequisites.md  -->

## Create the Confluent Cloud Cluster

> This creates your Confluent Cloud cluster.

The [Confluent Cloud Quickstart](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/get-started/index.html) will walk you through creating one. You can skip this step if you have already created a Confluent Cloud cluster with an equivalent configuration.

- Cluster Name: `my-zilla-iot-cc-cluster`
- Cluster Type: any
- Create Topics:

  - With cleanup policy "delete" to store MQTT messages:

  ```text:no-line-numbers
  mqtt-messages
  ```

  - With cleanup policy "compact" to store MQTT retained messages:

  ```text:no-line-numbers
  mqtt-retained
  ```

  - With cleanup policy "compact" to store MQTT sessions:

  ```text:no-line-numbers
  mqtt-sessions
  ```

### Create an API key

Follow the [Use API Keys to Control Access in Confluent Cloud](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/access-management/authenticate/api-keys/api-keys.html) instructions to create an API key and secret. Save the key and secret for use later.

### Create a Secret with SASL/SCRAM authentication params

> This creates a Secrets Manager secret with the necessary properties to access the Confluent Cloud cluster.

Follow the [Store a new secret](https://console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/newsecret) wizard with the following parameters and defaults.

::: note Locate your Bootstrap server URL
You can find your `<cc-bootstrap-server>` in your Confluent Cloud [cluster settings](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/clusters/broker-config.html#cluster-settings-console).
:::

- Secret Type: `Other type of secret`
- Value:

  - Plaintext JSON object:

    ```json:no-line-numbers
    {
      "api_key": "<cc-api-key>",
      "api_secret": "<cc-api-secret>",
      "bootstrap_server": "<cc-bootstrap-server>"
    }
    ```

- Secret Name: `my-zilla-iot-access-secret`
- Review and store the secret

## Subscribe via AWS Marketplace

The [Zilla Plus for Confluent Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-eblxkinsqbaks) is available through the AWS Marketplace. You can skip this step if you have already subscribed to Zilla Plus for Confluent Cloud via the AWS Marketplace.

To get started, visit the Proxy's Marketplace [Product Page](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-eblxkinsqbaks) and `Subscribe` to the offering. You should now see `Zilla Plus for Confluent Cloud` listed in your [AWS Marketplace](https://console.aws.amazon.com/marketplace) subscriptions.

## Deploy the IoT Ingest and Control MQTT Broker

> This initiates deployment of the Zilla Plus for Confluent Cloud stack via CloudFormation.

Navigate to your [AWS Marketplace](https://console.aws.amazon.com/marketplace) subscriptions and select `Zilla Plus for Confluent Cloud` to show the manage subscription page.

Parameters:

- Network Configuration
  - VPC: `my-zilla-iot-proxy-vpc`
  - Subnets: `my-zilla-iot-proxy-subnet-public-1a` `my-zilla-iot-proxy-subnet-public-1b`
- Confluent Cloud Configuration
  - Access Credentials and Bootstrap Server Secret ARN: `<my-zilla-iot-access-secret secret ARN>` \*1
  - Kafka Topics:
    - messages: `mqtt-messages`
    - retained: `mqtt-retained`
    - sessions: `mqtt-sessions`
- Zilla Plus Configuration
  - Instance count: `2`
  - Instance type: `t3.small` \*2
  - Role: `my-zilla-iot-role`
  - Security Groups: `my-zilla-iot-proxy-sg`
  - Public Port: `8883`
  - Public Wildcard DNS: `*.example.aklivity.io` \*3
  - Public TLS Certificate Key: `<TLS certificate private key secret ARN>` \*4
  - Key pair for SSH access: `my-key-pair` \*5
- \*Configuration Reference
  1. This is the ARN for the secret created in the [Create a Secret with SASL/SCRAM authentication params](#create-a-secret-with-sasl-scram-authentication-params) step of this guide.
  2. Consider the network throughput characteristics of the AWS instance type as that will impact the upper bound on network performance.
  3. Replace with your own custom wildcard DNS pattern mentioned in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) of this guide.
  4. This is the ARN of the created secret for the signed certificate's private key mentioned in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) of this guide.
  5. Follow the [Create Key Pair](../../how-tos/aws-services/create-key-pair.md) guide to create a new key pair to access EC2 instances via SSH.
