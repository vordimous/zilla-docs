## Overview

The [Zilla Plus for Confluent Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-eblxkinsqbaks) Secure Public Access proxy lets authorized Kafka clients connect, publish messages and subscribe to topics in your Confluent Cloud cluster via the internet.

In this guide we will deploy the Zilla Plus for Confluent Cloud Secure Public Access proxy and showcase globally trusted public internet connectivity to a Confluent Cloud cluster from a Kafka client, using the custom wildcard domain `*.example.aklivity.io`.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up internet access to your Confluent Cloud Cluster, you will need the following:

- an Confluent Cloud Cluster configured for SASL/SCRAM authentication
- subscription to Zilla Plus for Confluent Cloud via AWS Marketplace
- an VPC security group for the <ZillaPlus/> proxies
- an IAM security role for the <ZillaPlus/> proxies
- permission to modify global DNS records for a custom domain

### Create the Confluent Cloud Cluster in AWS with PrivateLink

> This creates your Confluent Cloud cluster with AWS PrivateLink in preparation for secure access via the internet.

An Confluent Cloud cluster deployed in AWS is needed for secure remote access via the internet. The [Confluent Cloud Quickstart](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/get-started/index.html) will walk you through creating one. You can skip this step if you have already created an Confluent Cloud cluster with equivalent configuration. We will use the below resource names to reference the AWS resources needed in this guide.

- Cluster Name: `my-cc-cluster`
- Cluster Type: `Enterprise`

Your Confluent Cloud Enterprise cluster will need a network connection. You will need to create a new [PrivateLink Attachment](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/networking/aws-platt.html) in network management tab. You will start configuring a new network connection to get a `PrivateLink Service Id`

- Name: `zilla_plus_secure_public_access`
- Add Connection
  - Name: `zilla_plus_privatelink_service`
  - Save the `PrivateLink Service Id`

Confluent Cloud Enterprise needs an AWS PrivateLink connection, for this we will [Create a VPC plus other VPC resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/create-vpc.html#create-vpc-and-other-resources) with the below resource names.

- Name tag auto-generation: `my-cce-privatelink`
- VPC endpoints: `none`
- Create the VPC

Now you will need to [Setup AWS PrivateLink](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/create-interface-endpoint.html) with the below resource names.

- Endpoint Name: `my-cce-privatelink-vpce`
- Service Name: the `PrivateLink Service Id` value you saved earlier
- VPC: `my-cce-privatelink-vpc`
- Subnets: Select `public` subnets for each availability zone
- Create the Endpoint

Finish the `zilla_plus_privatelink_service` connection wizard with the `PrivateLink Endpoint ID` found in your `my-cce-privatelink-vpce` from the [Endpoints table](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpcconsole/home#Endpoints:).

### Create the Route53 Hosted zone

> This creates a Route53 Hosted zone to for a generic DNS record can point to the Confluent Cloud with AWS PrivateLink used by the <ZillaPlus/> proxy.

Follow the [Create Hosted Zone](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/v2/hostedzones#CreateHostedZone) wizard with the following parameters and defaults.

- Domain name: `<Region>.aws.private.confluent.cloud`
- Type: `Private`
- Region: `<CC Cluster Region>`
- VPC: `my-cce-privatelink-vpc`
- Create the hosted zone

You will need to add an A Record for the wildcard to your `zilla_plus_privatelink_service` `my-cce-privatelink-vpce` VPC Endpoint has a DNS.

- Record Name: `*`
- Record Type: `A`
- Alias: `True`
- Route Traffic: `Alias to VPC Endpoint`
  - Region: `<CC Cluster Region>`
  - Select the `*.vpce-svc-*` DNS address
- Routing policy: `Simple Routing`
- Evaluate Target Heath: `Yes`
- Create the record

### Create the <ZillaPlus/> proxy security group

> This creates your <ZillaPlus/> proxy security group to allow Kafka clients and SSH access.

A VPC security group is needed for the <ZillaPlus/> proxies when they are launched.

Follow the [Create Security Group](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpcconsole/home#CreateSecurityGroup:) wizard with the following parameters and defaults. This creates your <ZillaPlus/> proxy security group to allow Kafka clients and SSH access.

::: note Check your selected region
Make sure you have selected the desired region, ex: `US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1`.
:::

- Name: `my-zilla-proxy-sg`
- VPC: `my-cce-privatelink-vpc`
- Description: `Kafka clients and SSH access`
- Add Inbound Rule
  - Type: `CUSTOM TCP`
  - Port Range: `9092`
  - Source type: `Anywhere-IPv4`
- Add Inbound Rule
  - Type: `SSH`
  - Source type: `My IP`
- Add Outbound Rule (if not exists)
  - Type: `All traffic`
  - Destination: `Anywhere-IPv4`
- Create the Security Group

::: warning Check your network settings
Your IP may be different when you SSH into the EC2 instance. VPNs and other networking infrastructure may cause the `My IP` inbound rule to fail. Instead, you can use one of the other ways AWS provides to execute commands in an EC2 instance.
:::

Navigate to the VPC Management Console [Security Groups](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home#securityGroups:) table. Select the `my-zilla-proxy-sg` security group you just created. You will create an inbound rule to allow all traffic inside itself.

- Add Inbound Rule
  - Type: `All Traffic`
  - Source type: `Custom`
  - Source: `my-zilla-proxy-sg`

Add the `my-zilla-proxy-sg` security group to your VPC Endpoint by finding your `my-cce-privatelink-vpce` from the [Endpoints table](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpcconsole/home#Endpoints:).

- Select your VPC endpoint
- `Actions` menu > select `Manage Security Groups`
- Select both security groups:
  - `default`
  - `my-zilla-proxy-sg`
- Save the changes

### Create the <ZillaPlus/> proxy IAM security role

> This creates an IAM security role to enable the required AWS services for the <ZillaPlus/> proxies.

Follow the [Create IAM Role](../aws-services/create-iam-role.md) guide to create an IAM security role with the following parameters:

::: code-tabs

@tab Name

```text:no-line-numbers
aklivity-zilla-proxy
```

@tab Policies

```text:no-line-numbers
AWSCertificateManagerReadOnly
AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore
```

:::

#### IAM role Inline Policies

This creates an IAM security role to enable the required AWS services for the <ZillaPlus/> proxies.

::: code-tabs

@tab Name

```text:no-line-numbers

      "Action": [
        "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
        "secretsmanager:DescribeSecret"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:secretsmanager:*:*:secret:wildcard.example.aklivity.io-*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

:::

::: info If you used a different secret name for your certificate key.

Replace `wildcard.example.aklivity.io` in the resource regular expression for:

```text:no-line-numbers
CCProxySecretsManagerRead
```

:::

## Subscribe via AWS Marketplace

The [Zilla Plus for Confluent Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-eblxkinsqbaks) is available through the AWS Marketplace. You can skip this step if you have already subscribed to Zilla Plus for Confluent Cloud via AWS Marketplace.

To get started, visit the Proxy's Marketplace [Product Page](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-eblxkinsqbaks) and `Subscribe` to the offering. You should now see `Zilla Plus for Confluent Cloud` listed in your [AWS Marketplace](https://console.aws.amazon.com/marketplace) subscriptions.

## Create the Server Certificate

We need a TLS Server Certificate for your custom DNS wildcard domain that can be trusted by a Kafka Client from anywhere.

Follow the [Create Server Certificate (LetsEncrypt)](../aws-services/create-server-certificate-letsencrypt.md) guide to create a new TLS Server Certificate. Use your own custom wildcard DNS domain in place of the example wildcard domain `*.example.aklivity.io`.

::: info
Note the server certificate secret ARN as we will need to reference it from the Secure Public Access CloudFormation template.
Make sure you have selected the desired region, ex: `US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1`.
:::

## Deploy the Zilla Plus Secure Public Access Proxy

  1. Follow the steps in the [Test Connectivity to Confluent Cloud](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/networking/testing.html#test-connectivity-to-ccloud) docs to get your clusters Bootstrap server URL.
  2. Consider the network throughput characteristics of the AWS instance type as that will impact the upper bound on network performance.
  3. This is the ARN of the created secret for the signed certificate's private key that was returned in the last step of the [Create Server Certificate (LetsEncrypt)](../aws-services/create-server-certificate-letsencrypt.md) guide. Make sure you have selected the desired region, ex: `US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1`.
  4. Replace with your own custom wildcard DNS pattern.
  5. Follow the [Create Key Pair](../aws-services/create-key-pair.md) guide to create a new key pair to access EC2 instances via SSH.

### Step 3. Configure stack options: `(use defaults)`

### Step 4. Review

Confirm the stack details are correct and `Submit` to start the CloudFormation deploy.

::: info
When your <ZillaPlus/> proxy is ready, the [CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation) will show `CREATE_COMPLETE` for the newly created stack.
:::

## Verify <ZillaPlus/> proxy Service

> This checks that the services and networking were properly configured.

Navigate to the [EC2 running instances dashboard.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home#Instances:instanceState=running)

::: note Check your selected region
Make sure you have selected the desired region, ex: `US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1`.
:::

Select either of the <ZillaPlus/> proxies launched by the CloudFormation template to show the details.

::: info
They each have an IAM Role name starting with `aklivity-zilla-proxy`.
:::

Find the `Public IPv4 Address` and then SSH into the instance.

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/<key-pair.cer> ec2-user@<instance-public-ip-address>
```

After logging in via SSH, check the status of the `zilla-plus` system service.

::: tabs

@tab Service is running

Verify that the `zilla-plus` service is active and logging output similar to that shown below.

```bash
systemctl status zilla-plus.service
```

```output:no-line-numbers
zilla-plus.service - Zilla Plus
   Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/zilla-plus.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)
   Active: active (running) since...
```

@tab Check Ports

Check for the active ports with `netstat`.

```bash
netstat -ntlp
```

```output:no-line-numbers
tcp6    0    0 :::9092    :::*    LISTEN    1726/.zpm/image/bin
```

@tab Check Zilla Logs

You can get an stdout dump of the `zilla-plus.service` using `journalctl`.

```bash
journalctl -e -u zilla-plus.service | tee -a /tmp/zilla.log
```

```output:no-line-numbers
systemd[1]: Started zilla-plus.service - Zilla Plus.
...
```

@tab Check Cloud Init Logs

All output from cloud-init is captured by default to `/var/log/cloud-init-output.log`. There shouldn't be any errors in this log.

```bash
cat /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
```

```output:no-line-numbers
Cloud-init v. 22.2.2 running 'init'...
```

:::

Check the networking of the <ZillaPlus/> proxy instances to confluent cloud.

::: tabs

@tab DNS resolving

Verify that the instance can resolve the private Route53 DNS address.

```bash
nslookup <Cluster ID>.<Region>.aws.private.confluent.cloud
```

```output:no-line-numbers
Server:		***
Address:	***

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	<Cluster ID>.<Region>.aws.private.confluent.cloud
Address: ***
```

@tab Check Ports

Check the communication over necessary ports with `netcat`.

```bash
nc -vz <Cluster ID>.<Region>.aws.private.confluent.cloud 9092
```

```output:no-line-numbers
Connection to <Cluster ID>.<Region>.aws.private.confluent.cloud port 9092 [tcp/italk] succeeded!
```

:::

Repeat these steps for each of the other <ZillaPlus/> proxies launched by the CloudFormation template if necessary.

### Configure Global DNS

<!-- @include: @partials/secure-public-access/configure-global-dns.md-->

## Verify Kafka Client Connectivity

<!-- @include: @partials/secure-public-access/verify-kafka-connect.md-->

### Configure the Kafka Client

With the Kaka client now installed we are ready to configure it and point it at the <ZillaPlus/> proxy.

The <ZillaPlus/> proxy relies on encrypted SASL/SCRAM so we need to create a file called `confluent.properties` that tells the Kafka client to use `SASL_SSL` as the security protocol with SCRAM-SHA-512 encryption.

Notice we used the username and password, you will need to replace those with your own API Keys credentials. Follow the [Use API Keys to Control Access in Confluent Cloud](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/access-management/authenticate/api-keys/api-keys.html) to associate your API key and secret for your cluster to the `SASL_SSL` username and password.

::: code-tabs

@tab confluent.properties

```text:no-line-numbers
# Required connection configs for Kafka producer, consumer, and admin
bootstrap.servers=kafka.example.aklivity.io:9092
#bootstrap.servers=lkc-0d9ox2.us-east-1.aws.private.confluent.cloud:9092
security.protocol=SASL_SSL
sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule required username='<cluser-api-key>' password='<cluser-api-secret>';
sasl.mechanism=PLAIN
# Required for correctness in Apache Kafka clients prior to 2.6
client.dns.lookup=use_all_dns_ips
```

:::

::: tip
As the TLS certificate is signed by a globally trusted certificate authority, there is no need to configure your Kafka client to override the trusted certificate authorities.
:::

### Test the Kafka Client

> This verifies internet connectivity to your Confluent Cloud cluster via Zilla Plus for Confluent Cloud.

We can now verify that the Kafka client can successfully communicate with your Confluent Cloud cluster via the internet from your local development environment to create a topic, then publish and subscribe to the same topic.

::: warning
Replace these TLS bootstrap server names accordingly for your own custom wildcard DNS pattern.
:::

#### Create a Topic

Use the Kafka client to create a topic called `zilla-proxy-test`, replacing `<tls-bootstrap-server-names>` in the command below with the TLS proxy names of your <ZillaPlus/> proxy:

```bash
bin/kafka-topics.sh \
--create \
--topic zilla-plus-test \
--partitions 3 \
--replication-factor 3 \
--command-config confluent.properties \
--bootstrap-server <tls-bootstrap-server-names>
```

::: tip A quick summary of what just happened

1. The Kafka client with access to the public internet issued a request to create a new topic
1. This request was directed to the internet-facing Network Load Balancer
1. The Network Load Balancer forwarded the request to the <ZillaPlus/> proxy
1. The <ZillaPlus/> proxy routed the request to the appropriate Confluent Cloud broker
1. The topic was created in the Confluent Cloud broker
1. Public access was verified

:::

#### Publish messages

Publish two messages to the newly created topic via the following producer command:

```bash
bin/kafka-console-producer.sh \
--topic zilla-plus-test \
--producer.config confluent.properties \
--broker-list <tls-bootstrap-server-names>
```

A prompt will appear for you to type in the messages:

```output:no-line-numbers
>This is my first event
>This is my second event
```

#### Receive messages

Read these messages back via the following consumer command:

```bash
bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh \
--topic zilla-plus-test \
--from-beginning \
--consumer.config confluent.properties \
--bootstrap-server <tls-bootstrap-server-names>
```

You should see the `This is my first event` and `This is my second event` messages.

```output:no-line-numbers
This is my first event
This is my second event
```
