::: info Estimated time to complete 10-15 minutes.

## Overview

The [Zilla Plus for Redpanda](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-sj4kquyndubiu) IoT Ingest and Control MQTT Broker lets clients publish messages and subscribe to topics that are proxied to Kafka topics in your Redpanda cluster.

## Prerequisites

<!-- @include: @partials/iot-ingest-control/prerequisites.md  -->

## Create the Redpanda cluster

> This creates your Redpanda cluster.

The [Redpanda Cloud Quickstart](https://docs.redpanda.com/current/get-started/quick-start-cloud/) will walk you through creating one. You can skip this step if you have already created a Redpanda cluster with an equivalent configuration.

- Cluster Name: `my-zilla-iot-rp-cluster`
- Cluster Type: any
- Create Topics:

  - With cleanup policy "delete" to store MQTT messages:

  ```text:no-line-numbers
  mqtt-messages
  ```

  - With cleanup policy "compact" to store MQTT retained messages:

  ```text:no-line-numbers
  mqtt-retained
  ```

  - With cleanup policy "compact" to store MQTT sessions:

  ```text:no-line-numbers
  mqtt-sessions
  ```

### Create an API key

Follow the Configure Authentication documentation to set up [SASL/SCRAM in Redpanda](https://docs.redpanda.com/current/manage/security/authentication/#scram). Save the username and password for use later.

### Create a Secret with SASL/SCRAM authentication params

> This creates a Secrets Manager secret with the necessary properties to access the Redpanda cluster.

Follow the [Store a new secret](https://console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/newsecret) wizard with the following parameters and defaults.

- Secret Type: `Other type of secret`
- Value:

  - Plaintext JSON object:

    ```json:no-line-numbers
    {
      "sasl_username": "<rp-username>",
      "sasl_password": "<rp-password>",
      "bootstrap_server": "<rp-bootstrap-server>"
    }
    ```

- Secret Name: `my-zilla-iot-access-secret`
- Review and store the secret

- \*Configuration Reference
  1. This is the ARN for the secret created in the [Create a Secret with SASL/SCRAM authentication params](#create-a-secret-with-sasl-scram-authentication-params) step of this guide.
  2. Consider the network throughput characteristics of the AWS instance type as that will impact the upper bound on network performance.
  3. Replace with your own custom wildcard DNS pattern mentioned in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) of this guide.
  4. This is the ARN of the created secret for the signed certificate's private key mentioned in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) of this guide.
  5. Follow the [Create Key Pair](../../how-tos/aws-services/create-key-pair.md) guide to create a new key pair to access EC2 instances via SSH.
