## Overview

The [Aklivity Public MSK Proxy](http://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B09HKJ54CX) lets authorized Kafka clients connect, publish messages and subscribe to topics in your Amazon MSK cluster via the internet.

In this guide we will deploy the Aklivity Public MSK Proxy and verify locally trusted public internet connectivity to your MSK cluster from a Kafka client in your development environment, using the wildcard domain `*.aklivity.example.com`.

The following AWS services are used by [Aklivity Public MSK Proxy](http://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B09HKJ54CX) for this deployment.

| Service                     | Required                                                                               | Usage                | Quota                                                                                         |

## Prerequisites

Before setting up internet access to your MSK Cluster, you will need the following:

* an MSK Cluster configured for TLS encrypted client access
* subscription to Aklivity Public MSK Proxy via AWS Marketplace
* an VPC security group for MSK Proxy instances
* an IAM security role for MSK Proxy instances
* permission to modify local DNS resolution files, such as `/etc/hosts` on MacOS

### Create MSK Cluster

We need to create an MSK cluster in preparation for secure remote access via the internet. You can skip this step if you have already created an MSK cluster with equivalent configuration.

Follow the [Create VPC](../../reference/amazon-msk/create-vpc.md) guide to create a VPC for your MSK cluster with the following parameters.

Name tag: `my-msk-cluster`\
IPv4 CIDR block: `10.0.0.0/16`\
Region: `us-east-1`

Then follow the [Create MSK Cluster](../../reference/amazon-msk/create-msk-cluster.md) guide to create your MSK cluster with the following parameters.

Name: `aklivity`\
VPC: `my-msk-cluster`\
Subnets: `my-msk-cluster-1a` `my-msk-cluster-1b` `my-msk-cluster-1c`

::: tip
This creates your MSK cluster in preparation for secure access via the internet.
:::

### Create the MSK Proxy security group

We need to create a VPC security group that will be used by the Public MSK Proxy instances when they are launched.

Follow the [Create Security Group](../../reference/amazon-msk/create-security-group.md) guide with the following parameters to create a security group in the same VPC as your MSK cluster.

VPC: `my-msk-cluster`\
Name: `my-msk-proxy`\
Description: Kafka clients and SSH access

### Inbound Rule

Type: `TCP 9094`\
Source: `<Any IPv4>`

### Inbound Rule

Type: `SSH`\
Source: `<My IP>`

::: tip
This creates your MSK proxy security group to allow Kafka clients and SSH access.
:::

### Update your MSK Cluster security group rules

Follow the [Update Security Group](../../reference/amazon-msk/update-security-group.md) guide with the following parameters to allow the MSK Proxy instances to communicate with the MSK cluster.

VPC: `vpc-xxx (my-msk-cluster)`\
Security Group: `default` `(MSK security group)`

### Inbound Rule

Type: `TCP 9094`\
Source: `Custom` `Security groups:`    `my-msk-proxy`

::: tip
This allows the MSK Proxy instances to access your MSK cluster.
:::

### Create the MSK Proxy IAM security role

Follow the [Create IAM Role](../../reference/amazon-msk/create-iam-role.md) guide to create an IAM security role with the following parameters:

Name: `aklivity-public-msk-proxy`\
Managed Policies: `AWSMarketplaceMeteringFullAccess` `AWSCertificateManagerReadOnly`\
`AWSCertificateManagerPrivateCAReadOnly` `ResourceGroupsandTagEditorReadOnlyAccess`

### Inline Policies

Name: `MSKProxySecretsManagerRead`\
Summary:

```json:no-line-numbers
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
        "secretsmanager:DescribeSecret"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:secretsmanager:*:*:secret:wildcard.aklivity.example.com-*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

::: info
Replace `wildcard.aklivity.example.com` in the resource regular expression for `MSKProxySecretsManagerRead` inline policy if you used a different secret name for your wildcard certificate key.
:::

::: tip
This creates an IAM security role to enable the required AWS services for the MSK Proxy  instances.
:::

### Subscribe via AWS Marketplace

The Aklivity Public MSK Proxy is [available](http://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B09HKJ54CX) through the AWS Marketplace. You can skip this step if you have already subscribed to Aklivity Private MSK Proxy via AWS Marketplace.

To get started, visit the Proxy's Marketplace [Product Page](http://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B09HKJ54CX) and `Subscribe` to the offering.

::: info
You should now see `Aklivity Public MSK Proxy` listed in your [AWS Marketplace Subscriptions](https://console.aws.amazon.com/marketplace).
:::

## Create the Server Certificate

We need a TLS Server Certificate for the wildcard domain `*.aklivty.example.com` that can be trusted by a Kafka Client in your local development environment.

Follow the [Create Server Certificate (ACM)](../../reference/amazon-msk/create-server-certificate-acm.md) guide to create a new TLS Server Certificate for the example wildcard domain `*.aklivty.example.com` .

::: info
Note the server certificate secret ARN as we will need to reference it from the Public MSK Proxy CloudFormation template.
:::

::: warning
Store the private certificate authority certificate in a file called `pca.pem` as we will need it to configure trust when testing the Kafka client.
:::

## Deploy the Public MSK Proxy

Navigate to your [AWS Marketplace Subscriptions](https://console.aws.amazon.com/marketplace) and select `Aklivity Public MSK Proxy` to show the details page. Then select `Launch CloudFormation stack` from the `Actions` menu in the `Agreement` section.

Make sure you have selected the desired region, such as `US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1`, then select the `Public MSK Proxy` fulfillment option and click `Continue to Launch`. Choose the action `Launch CloudFormation`, then click `Launch` to complete the `Create stack` wizard with the following details:

### Step 1. Specify template

Prepare template: `Template is ready`\
Specify template: `(auto-filled)`

### Step 2. Specify stack details

Stack name: `my-public-msk-proxy`

#### Parameters

#### Network Configuration

VPC: `my-msk-cluster`\
Subnets: `my-msk-cluster-1a` `my-msk-cluster-1b` `my-msk-cluster-1c`

#### MSK Configuration

Wildcard DNS pattern [1]: `*.aklivity.[...].amazonaws.com`\
Port number: `9094`

#### MSK Proxy Configuration

Instance count: `2`\
Instance type [2]: `t3.small`\
Role: `aklivity-public-msk-proxy`\
Security Groups: `msk-proxy`\
Secrets Manager Secret ARN [3]: [`<signed TLS certificate's private key secret ARN>`](../../reference/amazon-msk/create-server-certificate-acm.md#store-the-encrypted-secret)
Public Wildcard DNS: `*.aklivity.example.com`\
Public Port: `9094`\
Key pair for SSH access [4]: `<key pair>`\

### Step 3. Configure stack options: `(defaults)`

### Step 4. Review: `(review)`

**[1]** Follow the [Lookup MSK Server Names](../../reference/amazon-msk/lookup-msk-server-names.md) guide to discover the wildcard DNS pattern for your MSK cluster.

**[2]** Consider the network throughput characteristics of the AWS instance type as that will impact the upper bound on network performance.

**[3]** This is the ARN of the created secret for the signed certificate's private key that was returned in the last step of the [Create Server Certificate (ACM)](../../reference/amazon-msk/create-server-certificate-acm.md#store-the-encrypted-secret) guide.

**[4]** Follow the [Create Key Pair](../../reference/amazon-msk/create-key-pair.md) guide to create a new key pair to access EC2 instances via SSH.

Click `Create Stack`.

::: tip
This initiates deployment of the Aklivity Public MSK Proxy stack via CloudFormation.
:::

::: info
When your Public MSK Proxy is ready, the [CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation) will show **`CREATE_COMPLETE`** for the newly created stack.
:::

### Verify Public MSK Proxy Service

Navigate to the [EC2 Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2) and make sure you have selected the desired region in the upper right corner, such as `US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1`.

Under the `Resources by Region` section, select the `Instances` resource box to show your `Instances`. Select either of the Public MSK Proxy instances launched by the CloudFormation template to show the details.

::: info
They each have the IAM Role name `aklivity-public-msk-proxy`.
:::

Find the `Public IPv4 Address` and then SSH into the instance.

```shell:no-line-numbers
ssh -i ~/.ssh/<key-pair.cer> ec2-user@<instance-public-ip-address>
```

After logging in via SSH, check the status of the `msk-proxy` system service.

```bash:no-line-numbers
systemctl status msk-proxy.service
```

Verify that the `msk-proxy` service is active and logging output similar to that shown below.

```shell:no-line-numbers
● msk-proxy.service - MSK Proxy
   Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/msk-proxy.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)
   Active: active (running) since Tue 2021-08-24 20:56:51 UTC; 1 day 19h ago
 Main PID: 1803 (java)
   CGroup: /system.slice/msk-proxy.service
           └─...

Aug 26 06:56:54 ip-10-0-3-104.ec2.internal zilla[1803]: Recorded usage for record id ...
```

::: info
Repeat these steps for each of the other Public MSK Proxy instances launched by the CloudFormation template.
:::

## Verify Kafka Client Connectivity

To verify that we have successfully enabled public internet connectivity to our MSK cluster from the local development environment, we will use a generic Kafka client to create a topic, publish messages and then subscribe to receive these messages from our MSK cluster via the public internet.

### Install the Kafka Client

First, we must install a Java runtime that can be used by the Kafka client.

::: code-tabs#shell

@tab OSX and Linux

```bash:no-line-numbers
sudo yum install java-1.8.0
```

:::

Now we are ready to install the Kafka client:

::: code-tabs#shell

@tab OSX and Linux

```bash:no-line-numbers
wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/kafka/2.8.0/kafka_2.13-2.8.0.tgz
tar -xzf kafka_2.13-2.8.0.tgz
cd kafka_2.13-2.8.0
```

:::

::: info
We use a generic Kafka client here, however the setup for any Kafka client, including [KaDeck](https://www.xeotek.com/apache-kafka-monitoring-management/), [`Conduktor`](https://www.conduktor.io/download/), and [akhq.io](https://akhq.io/) will be largely similar. With the Public MSK Proxy you can use these GUI Kafka clients to configure and monitor your MSK applications, clusters and streams.
:::

#### Trust the Private Certificate Authority

Import the private certificate authority certificate into your trust store.

```shell:no-line-numbers
keytool -importcert -keystore /tmp/kafka.client.truststore.jks -storetype jks -storepass generated -alias pca -file Certificate.cer
```

::: info
When you followed the [Create Certificate Authority (ACM)](../../reference/amazon-msk/create-certificate-authority-acm.md) guide, you exported the private certificate authority certificate to a file called `Certificate.cer`.
:::

### Configure the Kafka Client

With the Kaka client now installed we are ready to configure it and point it at the Public MSK Proxy.

The MSK Proxy relies on TLS so we need to create a file called `client.properties` that tells the Kafka client to use SSL as the security protocol and to trust your private certificate authority as the signer of the `*.aklivity.example.com` certificate.

::: code-tabs#shell

@tab client.properties

```bash:no-line-numbers
security.protocol=SSL
ssl.truststore.location=/tmp/kafka.client.truststore.jks
```

:::

### Configure Local DNS

When using an example wildcard DNS such as `*.akivity.example.com` then the DNS entries are setup locally.

Navigate to the [CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation) and make sure you have selected the desired region in the upper right corner, such as `US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1`. Then select the `my-public-msk-proxy` stack to show the details.

In the stack `Outputs` tab, find the public DNS name of the `NetworkLoadBalancer`, and lookup the public IP addresses, as shown in the following example.

::: code-tabs#shell

@tab OSX and Linux

```bash:no-line-numbers
nslookup my-pu-Netwo-xxxxxxxxxxxx-yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.elb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

Server:  10.5.1.21
Address: 10.5.1.21#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name: my-pu-Netwo-xxxxxxxxxxxx-yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.elb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
Address: 107.21.117.233
Name: my-pu-Netwo-xxxxxxxxxxxx-yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.elb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
Address: 54.235.158.55
Name: my-pu-Netwo-xxxxxxxxxxxx-yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.elb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
Address: 3.226.64.246
```

:::

Then add local DNS entries for the bootstrap proxy names needed by the Kafka client.

::: code-tabs#shell

@tab OSX and Linux
/etc/hosts

```bash:no-line-numbers
107.21.117.233  b-1.aklivity.example.com b-2.aklivity.example.com b-3.aklivity.example.com
54.235.158.55   b-1.aklivity.example.com b-2.aklivity.example.com b-3.aklivity.example.com
3.226.64.246    b-1.aklivity.example.com b-2.aklivity.example.com b-3.aklivity.example.com
```

:::

This allows Kafka clients to use the following TLS bootstrap proxy names for privately signed TLS wildcard certificate:

```shell:no-line-numbers
b-1.aklivity.example.com:9094,b-2.aklivity.example.com:9094,b-3.aklivity.example.com:9094
```

You can use these bootstrap server names when connecting to your MSK cluster from your local development environment.

::: warning
If you add another broker to your MSK cluster, then you will need to add another local DNS entry to your development environment, such as `b-4.aklivity.example.com`. This is required only for [`Development`](development.md) deployments, not [`Production`](production.md) deployments.
:::

### Test the Kafka Client

We can now verify that the Kafka client can successfully communicate with your MSK cluster via the internet from your local development environment to create a topic, then publish and subscribe to the same topic.

Use the following as TLS bootstrap server names for the Kafka client:

```shell:no-line-numbers
b-1.aklivity.example.com:9094,b-2.aklivity.example.com:9094,b-3.aklivity.example.com:9094
```

#### Create a Topic

Use the Kafka client to create a topic called `public-proxy-test`, replacing`<tls-bootstrap-server-names>` **** in the command below with the TLS proxy names of your Public MSK Proxy:

```shell:no-line-numbers
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic public-proxy-test --partitions 3 --replication-factor 3 --command-config client.properties --bootstrap-server <tls-bootstrap-server-names>
```

A quick summary of what just happened:

1. The Kafka client with access to the public internet issued a request to create a new topic
2. This request was directed to the internet-facing Network Load Balancer
3. The Network Load Balancer forwarded the request to the Aklivity Public MSK Proxy
4. The Aklivity Public MSK Proxy routed the request to the appropriate MSK broker
5. The topic was created in the MSK broker
6. Public access was verified

#### Publish messages

Publish two messages to the newly created topic via the following producer command:

```shell:no-line-numbers
bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --topic public-proxy-test --producer.config client.properties --broker-list <tls-bootstrap-server-names>
```

A prompt will appear for you to type in the messages:

```shell:no-line-numbers
>This is my first event
>This is my second event
```

#### Receive messages

Read these messages back via the following consumer command:

```shell:no-line-numbers
bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic public-proxy-test --from-beginning --consumer.config client.properties --bootstrap-server <tls-bootstrap-server-names>
```

You should see the `This is my first event` and `This is my second event` messages.

```shell:no-line-numbers
This is my first event
This is my second event
```

::: tip
This verifies internet connectivity to your MSK cluster from your development environment via [Aklivity Public MSK Proxy](http://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B09HKJ54CX)!
:::

## Monitor the Public MSK Proxy

The CloudFormation template used to deploy the Public MSK Proxy includes a Network Load Balancer that can be monitored via [CloudWatch](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch) to verify continuous health.

Network Load Balancers have [many available metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/load-balancer-cloudwatch-metrics.html), including the following.

| Metric                   | Description                                                                                                                                          |

| `TCP_Target_Reset_Count` | The total number of reset (RST) packets sent from a target to a client. These resets are generated by the target and forwarded by the load balancer. |
| `UnHealthyHostCount`     | The number of targets that are considered unhealthy.                                                                                                 |

You can use [CloudWatch](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch) to create a dashboard to monitor these metrics and set alarms to alert you when specific metric thresholds are reached.

## Upgrade the Public MSK Proxy

Navigate to your [AWS Marketplace Subscriptions](https://console.aws.amazon.com/marketplace) and select `Aklivity Public MSK Proxy` to show the details page. Then select `Launch CloudFormation stack` from the `Actions` menu in the `Agreement` section.

Make sure you have selected the desired region, such as `US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1`, then select the `Public MSK Proxy` fulfillment option and click `Continue to Launch`. Choose the action `Launch CloudFormation`, then click `Launch` to show the URL of the CloudFormation template.

Copy the CloudFormation template Amazon S3 URL and then select your existing CloudFormation Stack from a previous deployment of `Aklivity Public MSK Proxy`. Click `Update` and `Replace current template` with the copied Amazon S3 URL. Then complete the wizard to deploy the updated stack.

CloudFormation will incrementally deploy the MSK Proxy instances for the new version behind the same Network Load Balancer, checking for successful deployment before terminating the MSK Proxy instances for the previous version.

Connected clients will see their connections drop, and when they reconnect automatically, the Network Load Balancer will direct them to the new MSK Proxy instances. If the stack update is unsuccessful, then CloudFormation will rollback to use the previous stack deployment.
