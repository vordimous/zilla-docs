# Get Started

The Get Started guides below will walk you through the steps to install zilla and connect zilla to your existing kafka installation.

## [Installing Zilla](install/)

Run on prem or in the cloud.

## [Connecting to Kafka](connecting-to-kafka/)

Here we show you how to change the Zilla configuration to use your own Kafka cluster instead of using a local Kafka deployment in a docker stack.
